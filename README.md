# the-silver-project

I created The Silver Project as a way to document my learning process. Each day I learn something new, I update this repository with what I learned, as well as an example of it. This should both serve to help me remember what I've learned, as well as educate others. 

My primary focus will be Java; however, I am sure there will be other languages, concepts and neat tips thrown in.
